Sript ‘run_analysis.R’ gets data from unzipped ‘getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip’, transforms them in accordance with the process described in ‘CodeBook.md’ and exports them into files ‘UCI_HAR_Dataset.txt’ and ‘UCI_HAR_Means.txt’.


Files:
‘getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip’ - original dataset from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
(should be unzipped in the same folder) 

‘run_analysis.R’ - script for cleaning up the data

‘CodeBook.md’ - code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data

‘UCI_HAR_Dataset.txt’ - result of the cleaning, full dataset

‘UCI_HAR_Means.txt’ - summary file, contains averages of each variable for each activity and each subject
